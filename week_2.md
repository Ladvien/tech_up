## Python Syntax
Most programming languages are particular about how they are written. For example, the `C++` language would get upset if removed any character from the following program.

```cpp
int main() {
    int n, sum = 0;
}
```

This sort of extreme sensitivity has led to jokes such as:

> Programming is like writing a novel, except when your writing a novel the whole thing doesn't catch on fire if you leave at the semicolon on page 315.

Fortunately, Python isn't quite as irritating. It does away with superfluous characters like all those semicolons at the end of each line. Instead, if relies on indentation to understand what you are trying to do.

For example,
```python
if something == True:
    # Stuff here will happen only if it is `something` is true.

    if something_else == True:
        # Stuff here will only happen if `something` -and- `something_else` are true
    
    # Stuff here will happen only if it is `something` is true.

# Stuff here will happen regardless if `something` or `something_else` are true.
```

This indentation, combined with the keywords and special characters make up the Python syntax.

Here's a robust video on the matter (pro tip, we often watch videos on 2x speed):

## Style Guides
Often, the most noticeable difference between an senior program and a junior is their code style--or, lack thereof.  In programming, it is often pretty easy to get a program to do the one thing you need it to. However, building a program with thousands of tasks all building on each other requires discipline and skill to construct.  One of the ways professional programmers manage this complexity is through code styling.

Code styling is different than syntax. For example,

```python
def get_player_history(player_id: int)
    player_record = records[player_id]
    return player_record["history"]

def x(a):
    return records[x]["history"]
```
Both of these functions are the same, they retrieve a player's history after retrieving it from `records` using the `player_id`. However, the second would be extremely hard to debug. And the adage goes, "Programming is 15 minutes writing code and 5 hours debugging it."

Having code which is easy to read for your future self and others will pay continuous dividends. "Good styled" code can be somewhat objective, however, several organizations have put together style guides which are extremely common and are derived from legitimate rules.

Take for example,
```python
bio = "This is the string which never ends, it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on..."
```
Above is a string being assigned to the variable `bio`. Most likely, you must scroll to the right to read the entire text.  This means you probably need to stop typing, switch to your mouse, and scroll over. All wasted effort. As such, most style guides suggest you keep strings like this to ~80 characters as this commonly fits on screen without scrolling right. And depending on the language, there are usually tricks for breaking it up.

For example, here's how one way to split it up in Python.

```python
bio = "This is the string which never ends," + \ 
"it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and " + \
"on and on and on and on and on and on and on..."
```

A few style guides to be aware of:
* [Pep 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) -- the old school Python style guide.
* [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html) -- the young kid on the block, but on the verge of exceeding `pep 8` in adoption.

For the rest of the course, I will be requesting you style all of your code in `black` format. "Wow, Thomas, that's a bit much for crash course, dude." Maybe. But it is best you start now--it will make you stand out among others applicants if it is habit for you.

Also, `black` has a companion tool which will automatically format your code! ðŸŽ‰

### Installing Black
1. Open your `cmd` or `zsh` terminals.
2. Type `pip install black`.
3. Find a Python file (`.py`) you would like to format
4. Type `black /path/to/file`

Or, if you want to format all of your files in your project go to the project main directory and type `black *`.

> Note, `black` can only format projects which will run. If there are syntax issues (code won't run) then `black` will give you an error when formatting them.
